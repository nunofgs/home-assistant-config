## Introduction

[![build status][travis-image]][travis-url]

This is my configuration for [Home Assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant). It is split into multiple files and is ready to go with the exception of the `secrets.yaml` file.

Feel free to draw inspiration from it or make a suggestion in the [issues](https://github.com/nunofgs/home-assistant-config/issues)!
